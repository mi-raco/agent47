Best Practice:

  What is quality code?:
    - easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.
    - easy to test and easy to debug.
    - easy to extend and easy to refactor.
    - easy to integrate and easy to deploy.
    - easy to scale and easy to monitor.
    - easy to secure and easy to optimize.
    - easy to document and easy to collaborate on.

  codebase-maintainability:
    why: 
      - Codebase gets harder to maintain as it grows
      - Codebase gets harder to understand as it grows
    how:
      - All code should be clean and follow PEP8 standards.
      - The cognitive complexity of functions should be kept low.
      - Good separation of responsibilities in the final product.
      - Prefer concise templating languages like HAML.
      - Prefer frameworks like NUXT3, opinionated about the project structure and conventions.
      - Use versatile component libraries that are both fit for purpose and easy to extend.
      - Only use docstring comments, documentation should reveal the local scope logic only.
      - Avoid code repetition. There should be a single-source of truth for any operation.
      - Use a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes.
      - Use object oriented patterns and type hints to make the codebase more readable and maintainable.

  separation-of-responsibility:
    why: 
      - codebase should be easy to test and mock at every level.
      - codebase should be easy to maintain and extend.
      - codebase should be modular enough to support switching integrations or components.
      - codebase should be easy to understand and debug.
    solution:
      Implement code in layers:
        Presentation Layer: 
          - UI components, API endpoints, and other user-facing elements.
          - Only service calling and data transformation logic should be present here.
          - Types for this layer can be found in the schemas module.
        Business Logic Layer: The core logic of the application, where the business rules are enforced.
          - The layer that interacts with the presentation layer and the data access layer.
          - The layer that handles the business logic and the application state.
          - Types for this layer can be found in the interfaces module.
        Data Access Layer: 
          - The layer that interacts with the database or external services.
          - The layer that handles the data transformation and validation.
          - Types for this layer can be found in the models module.
